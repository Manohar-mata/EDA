# EDA
Project 1 


I did an exploratory data analysis on laptop pricing using Pandas. I extracted many insights from the data and represented them visually using Matplotlib and Seaborn. steps involved in doing EDA:

1. Data cleaning and Pre-Processing

2. Univariate Analysis - 1. Histograms(Numerical Data), 2. Barplot(Categorical)

3. Bivariate Analysis  - 2. Scatterplot(NUM and NUM), 2.Boxplot(NUM and CAT).
